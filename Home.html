		<h1>Let the games begin!</h1>
		<h3>Game objective</h3>
		<p>The goal of this exercise is to get more practice building websites and getting familiar with Git and GitHub.  As a team, we will be trying to make this website as fun and random as possible, with everyone working on it at the same time (or the same work, since we may be split across shifts).  Some specific tasks to try and do during time might include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create branches</i>
			<li>Create pull requests</li>
			<li>Generate merge conflicts and resolve them</li>
			<li>Get practice editing the readme and using markdown</li>
			<li>Add images and embed content onto the site</li>
			<li>Style with CSS</li>
			<li>Add more web pages, css files, etc.</li>
			<li>Create issues on GitHub and request reviewers</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Rules</h3>
		<p>As much as possible, try to communicate with each other as a team.  Make comments on PRs, request each other as reviewers, approve pages, get to know each other.  You can post your hobbies or pictures, embed videos, etc.</p>
		<p>Other rules:</p>	
		<ul>
			<li>Don't delete the entire project or mess with the permissions</li>
			<li>Respect everyone else</li>
			<li>No offensive pictures or other content (keep it work-appropriate)</li>
		</ul>
